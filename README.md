# Description
Chest Kits is a plugin that gives your PMMP server kits. These aren't your normal kits oh no they're a special type of kits. The items aren't given directly but stored in a chest until you interact with the chest kit. It will automatically add the items within the players inventory.

All permission based, no economy plugins needed!

Required plugin: Any Ranks Plugin...

# Features
- Chest are used as kits
- Form menu displaying the kits/confirmation menu
- Permission based (Head over to the 'kits.yml' to get started)
- Cooldowns with a formatted message and easy to understand
- Create unlimited kits

# TODO
- [ ] Customizable messages/UI
- [ ] A way to enable/disable chest kits (automatically adds the items within the players inventory without the use of a chest)
- [ ] A way to enable/disable UIs (Chat based kit claim)

Got an idea please open a pull request or bug report!

# Required plugin/extension
This plugin requires a virion called [FormAPI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/jojoe77777/FormAPI/libFormAPI)

Make sure you have it in the same folder.

**Do not open a issue saying that it's broken because I can guarantee 100% that the plugin works with no bugs/issues. Make sure you download the FormAPI along with the ChestKitPro**
