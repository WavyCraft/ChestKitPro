# Description
Chest Kits is a plugin that gives your PMMP server kits. These aren't your normal kits oh no they're a special type of kits. The items aren't given directly but stored in a chest until you interact with the chest kit. It will automatically add the items within the players inventory.

All permission based, no economy plugins needed!

Required plugin: Any Ranks Plugin...

# Features
- Chest are used as kits
- Form menu displaying the kits/confirmation menu
- Permission based (Head over to the 'kits.yml' to get started)

# TODO
- [ ] Customizable messages/UI
